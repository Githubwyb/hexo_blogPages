> Talk about a special gift you once gave someone.Describe the gift and explain why it was special.

# Example Answers

One special gift I gave to my boyfriend was a bronze ring from his favorite movie, the Lord of the Rings. It looks exactly like the ring showed in the movie, with the words ‘one ring controls them all’ engraved on, and fits perfectly on his index finger. The reason why I picked it up for his birthday was that he loves this movie series so much and every time, to be honest, for real every time when we are wandering in the mall, he would visit every jewelry shop to look for the similar ring. And he even wishes to have our wedding ring engraved with the same words on. He’s cute, right? So when I gave this ring to him, he started to wear it every time we went out for our date! Isn’t it so special?

# My Own Answers

One special gift I gave to my little brother was a dark blue basketball, which he said that it was his favorite gift. It is clear to say that he loves playing basketball very much, right? The reason why I picked it up for his birthday was that he wants to have his own basketball and every time, to be honest, for real every time when we are hanging out, he would visit the sports shop to watch it. I'm a basketball fans, too. So I know the feelings to have a basketball as a gift. We always watch the NBA games together and argue who is the best player. And we almost spent all the spare time playing basketball. Isn't it so special?
